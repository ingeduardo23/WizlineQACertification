Hi there! :) # WizlineQACertification

Notes for comprension:

I have all of these Scripts in Package.json:

testing-all-firefox //This one is for testing all the tescases in Firefox Browser
testing-all-chromium  //This one is for testing all the tescases in Chromium Browser

//These are for testing each tescase in all the browsers you have installed in your PC
test1-all-browsers
test2-all-browsers
test3-all-browsers 
test4-all-browsers
test5-all-browsers 

NOTE FOR WIZELINE MENTORS : I want to apologize myself because I make the ROLES part, for the bonus. 
But sincerelly I do not know how to apply it in the project. I'm Really Sorry
